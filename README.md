# sortdir

A short python script that organizes the files in a given directory into new directories based on their extension.

**NOTE**: This is an old script that I made a long time ago while I was still learning python.

## Usage

To use the script, simply execute:
```
$ python src/sortdir.py path
```
...where `path` is the path to the directory that you want to sort.
